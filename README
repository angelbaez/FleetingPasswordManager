README for Fleeting Password Manager
====================================

Fleeting Password Manager is a program that generates passwords 
from given master password, URL and user name. 

The idea is that the user needs to remember only her master password. 
Other passwords are generated from the input data when needed.

The generated password is always the same with the same input and is 
not stored to anywhere.

The length of the generated password is configurable between 8 and 32 
characters and FPM can remember wanted URL/User-pairs.

Features
--------

* Simple user interface
* Combined password generator and manager
* On-the-fly password generation from the login data
* Password length configurable from 8 to 32 characters
* Portable Qt-based source code

Examples
--------

For input information:

Master password: Qwerty123
URL: www.google.com
User: johndoe

The generated 8-char password is always: OTFkOTBk

Notice, that the URL doesn't have to be the *real* URL,
it just has to be the same every time:

For input data:

Master password: Qwerty123
URL: google
User: johndoe

The generated 8-char password is now always: NTA3NzMy
