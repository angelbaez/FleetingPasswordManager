README for Fleeting Password Manager
====================================

Fleeting Password Manager is a program that generates passwords 
from given master password, URL and user name. 

The idea is that the user needs to remember only her master password. 
Other passwords are generated from the input data when needed.

The generated password is always the same with the same input and is 
not stored to anywhere.

The length of the generated password is configurable between 8 and 32 
characters and FPM can remember wanted URL/User-pairs.

Features
--------

* Simple user interface
* Combined password generator and manager
* On-the-fly password generation corresponding to the login data
  (Passwords are never saved in any form)
* Password length configurable from 8 to 32 characters
* Portable Qt-based source code

Examples
--------

For input information:

Master password: qwerty123
URL: www.facebook.com
User: john.doe@example.com

The generated 8-char password is always: OGM2ZjVk
This password can then be copy-pasted to the facebook
login field.

Notice, that the URL doesn't have to be the *real* URL,
it just has to be *exactly* the same every time, something 
that you remember.

You can use "gmail" Gmail, "facebook" for www.facebook.com,
"linkedin" for www.linkedin.com and so on. 

For input data:

Master password: qwerty123
URL: facebook
User: john.doe@example.com

The generated 8-char password is now always: ZjQxOWM1.

Exporting saved logins
----------------------

As mentioned before, Fleeting Password Manager never saves
any passwords. However, user name and url-pairs can be saved.
On Linux, this data is located as a simple text file at:

    ~/.config/fleetingpm/fleetingpm.conf

If you copy this file to the same location in some other
Linux-based system, you'll get the same saved logins.
