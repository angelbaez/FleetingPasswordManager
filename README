README for Fleeting Password Manager
====================================

With Fleeting Password Manager one can create passwords for 
different (web) services. The idea is that the user gives a base password, 
URL and user name, and FPM then generates the corresponding password
out of the given input data. 

The generated password is always the same with the same input and is 
not stored to anywhere, which is the whole idea here. The user needs to
remember only his base password and all the other passwords can be then 
generated when needed. 

The length of the generated password is configurable between 8 and 32 
characters and FPM can remember wanted URL/User-pairs.

Example
=======

For input information:

Base password: Qwerty123
URL: www.google.com
User: johndoe

The generated 8-char password is always: OTFkOTBk

Notice, that the URL doesn't have to be the *real* URL,
but it has to be the same every time:

For input information:

Base password: Qwerty123
URL: google
User: johndoe

The generated 8-char password is now always: NTA3NzMy
