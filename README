README for Fleeting Password Manager
====================================

With Fleeting Password Manager one can create passwords for 
different web services. The idea is that the user gives a base password, 
URL and user name and FPM then generates the corresponding password. 
The generated password is always the same with the same input and is 
not stored to anywhere. The user has to remember only his base password
(that can be same for all services), user name and the URL.

The length of the generated password is configurable between 8 and 32 
characters.

Example
=======

For input information:

Base password: Qwerty123
URL: www.google.com
User: johndoe

The generated 8-char password is always: OTFkOTBk

Notice, that the URL doesn't have to be the *real* URL,
but it has to be the same every time:

For input information:

Base password: Qwerty123
URL: google
User: johndoe

The generated 8-char password is always: NTA3NzMy
