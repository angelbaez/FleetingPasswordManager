<h1><center><u>Instructions for Fleeting Password Manager</u></center></h1>

<h2>General</h2>
<p>
Fleeting Password Manager is a program that generates pseudo-random passwords from given <b>master password, URL/ID</b> and <b>user name</b>. The master password should be common to all passwords and URL/ID should be the url of the service (e.g. www.facebook.com) or some part of it (e.g. facebook). Fleeting Password Manager then combines the master password, URL/ID and the given user name and generates the corresponding login password. 
</p>
<p>
The user then changes her password to the one generated by Fleeting Password Manager and she needs to remember only her master password. Other passwords are always generated <b>on-the-fly</b> from the given login data when needed.
</p>
<p> 
The generated passwords are always the same with the same input and <b>are not stored to anywhere</b>, which is actually the whole point of Fleeting Password Manager. The length of the generated password is configurable between 8 and 32 characters and Fleeting Password Manager can remember wanted URL/User-pairs. 
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>
For login information:
</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>Master password:</td><td>qwerty123</td></tr>
<tr><td>URL/ID:</td><td>www.facebook.com</td></tr>
<tr><td>User name:</td><td>john.doe@example.com</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The generated 8-char password is always: OGM2ZjVk.
</p>
<p>
This password can then be copy-pasted to the facebook
login field.
</p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>
Notice, that the URL doesn't have to be the <b>real</b> URL,
it just has to be <b>exactly</b> the same every time, something 
that you remember. You can use "gmail" for Gmail, "facebook" 
for www.facebook.com, "linkedin" for www.linkedin.com and so on. 
</p>
<p>
For login information:
</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>Master password:</td><td>qwerty123</td></tr>
<tr><td>URL:</td><td>facebook</td></tr>
<tr><td>User:</td><td>john.doe@example.com</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The generated 8-char password is now always: ZjQxOWM1.
</p>

<h2>Importing / exporting saved logins</h2>
<p>
As mentioned before, Fleeting Password Manager never saves
any passwords. However, user name and url-pairs can be saved.
This data can also be exported and imported from the file menu.
</p>
<p>
The exported data is saved in XML-format. Importing logins never
deletes the previous ones, but may update already existing url's 
with new user names.
</p>

<h2>Location of the settings and saved logins</h2>
<p>
On Linux, the settings data is located as a simple text file in
the user's home directory:

    ~/.config/fleetingpm/fleetingpm.conf
</p>
<p>
If you copy this file to the same location in some other
Linux-based system, you'll get the same saved logins and settings.
