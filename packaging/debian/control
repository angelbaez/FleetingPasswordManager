Description: A password manager and generator written in Qt
 Fleeting Password Manager is a program that generates passwords 
 from given master password, URL and user name. 
 .
 The idea is that the user needs to remember only her master password. 
 Other passwords are generated on-the-fly from the input data when needed.
 .
 The generated password is always the same with the same input and is 
 not stored to anywhere. 
 .
 The length of the generated password is configurable between 8 and 32 
 characters. URL/User-pairs can be saved.
