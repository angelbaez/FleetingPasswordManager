Install instructions for Fleeting Password Manager
==================================================

It's strongly recommended to install FPM using your OS's package
system rather than using setup.py yourself.

If you don't have this option, please make sure you satisfy FPM's
dependencies yourself:

 * Python 2.4+, 2.7 recommended:
     Debian/Ubuntu: python

 * Python Qt bindings:
     Debian/Ubuntu: python-pyside

If you don't care about native language support or icons, FPM
should run just fine directly from this directory, just:

    ./fleetingpm

To install properly, run (as root):

    ./setup.py install --record=install-files.txt

See --help for an overview of the available options; e.g. --prefix to
install to a custom base directory, and --without-gettext to avoid
installing natural language support files.

setup.py supports basic uninstallation provided --record was used for
installation as above:

    ./setup.py uninstall --manifest=install-files.txt
