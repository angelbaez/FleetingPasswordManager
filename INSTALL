Install instructions for Fleeting Password Manager
==================================================

Linux 
-----

It's strongly recommended to install fleetingpm using your OS's package
system rather than using setup.py yourself.

If you don't have this option, please make sure you satisfy fleetingpm's
dependencies yourself:

 * Python 2.4+, 2.7 recommended:
     Ubuntu package: python

 * Python Qt bindings:
     Ubuntu package: python-pyside

If you don't care about native language support or icons, fleetingpm
should run just fine directly from this directory, just:

    ./fleetingpm

To install properly, run (as root):

    ./setup.py install --record=install-files.txt

See --help for an overview of the available options; e.g. --prefix to
install to a custom base directory, and --without-gettext to avoid
installing natural language support files.

setup.py supports basic uninstallation provided --record was used for
installation as above:

    ./setup.py uninstall --manifest=install-files.txt

Windows
-------

Fleetingpm runs perfectly also on Windows, but currently there's
no installation package for Windows available. 

1) Install PySide and Python 2.7 for Windows
2) Run fleetinpm from this directory through Python:

    C:\[YourPythonInstallDir]\python27.exe fleetingpm
