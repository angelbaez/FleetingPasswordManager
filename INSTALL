Install instructions for Fleeting Password Manager
==================================================

It's strongly recommended to install fleetingpm using your OS's package
system rather than building yourself.

If you don't have this option, please make sure you satisfy fleetingpm's
build dependencies yourself. Fleetingpm is a pure Qt4 project, so you
must have the Qt4 development files and environment installed.

Ubuntu package: libqt4-dev

Configure the project:

    ./configure

    Default install prefix is /usr, and it can be changed
    to e.g. /usr/local like this:

    PREFIX=/usr/local ./configure

Build:

    make

If you don't care about native language support or icons, fleetingpm
should run just fine directly from this directory, just:

    ./fleetingpm

To install properly, run (as root):

    make install

Now Fleeting Password Manager shoud appear in your applications 
(Accessories in Gnome and Unity) menu.
