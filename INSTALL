Build & install instructions
============================

These are build & install instructions for Fleeting Password Manager.

Build dependencies
------------------

Fleetingpm uses CMake as the build system.

Currently the build depends on Qt4/Qt5 only.

Both Qt4 and Qt5 are supported, and Qt4 is used by default.

Qt5 can be enabled by passing -DUseQt5=1 to cmake or to
the configure script.

Fleetingpm also exploits some features of the C++11
standard, so a compliant compiler is required (GCC >= 4.6).

Building in the command line on Linux (tested on Ubuntu 12.04)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Development build (the game can be run without installing anything):

1) Install Qt4 development files (libqt4-dev on Ubuntu).
2) Install CMake.
3) Go to the source directory and run:

$ ./configure

This runs CMake that generates the makefiles.
You can also run cmake directly. The configure script
is only for convenience and is just a wrapper for cmake. 

If everything went ok, run:
  
$ make

Run the application:

$ ./fleetingpm

Install the binaries and data files:

$ sudo make install

This install also the desktop files so fleetingpm
should appear in your application menu.
